    "At the beginning of this chapter you have seen the Atlas humanoid doing a backflip. Now consider the robot in the two states captured in the figure above. Assuming that Atlas's actuators can produce unbounded torques  $u$, establish whether or not each of the following statements is true. Briefly justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*a. The state of the humanoid can be represented by the angles and the angular velocities of all its joints.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Ans:</u> No, the humanoid is a floating system, so the state of the humanoid also includes the position and orientation of the base (center of mass).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*b. While doing the backflip (state in the left figure), the humanoid is fully actuated.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Ans:</u> No, the humanoid is underactuated. During the backflip, the robot cannot apply any wrench to change the trajectory of the center of mass. \n",
    "\n",
    "*c. While standing (state in the right figure), the humanoid is fully actuated.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Ans:</u> No, it is underactuated. The number of actuators is less than the number of degrees of freedom (i.e., there are six degrees of freedom more in the floating base than the number of actuators)."

    "b. <u>Ans:</u> Since $u = m\\ddot{q}$, this input can only move the system along a vertical line (y-axis) in the phase portrait. Moreover, the change in $q$ is determined by the value of $\\dot{q}$. Therefore, it cannot move the system along a straight line following the blue trajectory (i.e., the resultant vector can have only a positive x-component in this region). On the other hand, we can move the system along the red trajectory, as the resultant vector can have a negative x-component in this region. \n",
    "\n",
    "c. <u>Ans:</u> No, for example, when $\\mathbf{\\dot{q}}_{des}$ > 0 and $\\mathbf{q}_{des} = 0$, $\\mathbf{q}$ will change according to $\\mathbf{\\dot{q}}$. We cannot find any possible $u$ that can maintain $\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{x}_{des}(t)$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n"

    "b. <u>Ans:</u> It cannot maintain a zero change in orientation while simultaneously changing position in the x and y directions. To illustrate this, consider the following example: $\\ddot{\\theta} = 0, \\ddot{y} = 3$ and $\\ddot{x} = 1$. This is not possible because the quadrotor must rotate in order to move in the x direction."
